**Armada Rules Collective (ARC) Guiding Principles v1.0**

***Official Statement***

1. ARC will look at Armada gameplay both from a systems level (squadrons, objectives, fleet archetypes) and an individual card level, recognizing that changes at the systems level are more complex and will require more resources and time to test thoroughly, and entail more risk to the game state  
2. Generally ARC will buff underperforming game elements rather than nerf overperforming elements, though exceptions may be made in rare cases.  
3. ARC will maintain an appropriate pace of rules releases, balancing time for players to adjust to new metas while keeping interest alive. Initially we are planning on updates twice a year, though 2025 may be unusual depending on the timing of the AMG update.

4. Definition of “Balanced for Competitive Tournament Play” for Armada  
   1. Encourage a wide variety of fleet archetypes taken in tournament play, between and amongst all factions if possible.    
   2. Recognize that local metas will differ; ARC will need to survey results broadly across the world and online when examining archetypes, and give time for metas to adapt after rules changes.    
   3. Not all cards need to be competitively viable; chasing that goal may lead to unnecessary power creep.  Again, encouraging a wide variety of viable fleet archetypes in competitive play for all factions is the priority

      

5. General Principles  
   1. Rule \#1:  Don’t Break the Game. ARC should take a conservative approach to SW Armada, as the game is in a relatively balanced state.  
   2. But at the same time, recognize that stagnation is deadly for a modern game system with a competitive scene.  Injecting interest via point changes, errata, and some new content will help keep interest alive.    
   3. Balancing 5.1 and 5.2 may be difficult, but necessary.    
   4. Changes to the game by ARC will be made with intention and those intentions will be clearly communicated in the releases.  This will help players understand why an upgrade changed points, or why upgrade wording was changed.
