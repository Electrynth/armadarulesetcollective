      1. Should a member of the Core Executive become incapacitated the remaining members may alter the composition by a majority vote.  
      2. Alterations to the membership of the Core Executive will be by majority vote.  
      3. This ARC Terms of Reference (TOR) document can be altered by a unanimous vote of the Core Executive if composed of 3 voting members.  If composed of 4 or more voting members, a supermajority vote (75%) is required to alter the TOR.

      4. Abstentions do not count as votes, *i.e.* they reduce the denominator when checking for majority/supermajority/unanimity.  Nonresponse to a vote after 14 days of motion shall count as an abstention.

      5. Quorum for meetings shall be set at 66% of the voting Core Executive, with at least 1 week’s notice of the meeting to all Core Executive members.

         

4. Communication:  
   1. ARC will post official statements only after they have been endorsed by the Core Executive.  Official statements will be clearly labelled as such.  
   2. Members of ARC are free to make personal statements but their comments should not be interpreted as anything other than personal opinion; official ARC position statements will be as per point 4.1.  This point protects the ability of ARC members to be full members of the community.  
   3. ARC messages will be distributed widely including on Discord, Facebook, and Reddit Armada groups, and a potential future website.
