      answer: "ARC is a community-driven initiative dedicated to providing accurate, up-to-date rules and resources for Star Wars: Armada players worldwide. We maintain a comprehensive rules database and provide tools to enhance the gaming experience. This includes slowly introducing new content to the game to enrich the competitive scene."

    },
    {
      question: "How will ARC ensure new content is balanced and fair for the competitive scene and the game?",
      answer: "ARC will conduct extensive playtesting of new content through a dedicated testing team and community volunteers.

    {
      question: "How often are rules updated?",

Our team regularly reviews and updates content to ensure accuracy and relevance."
