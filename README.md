# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

## URL Structure

### Blog Posts
Blog posts now use SEO-friendly URLs based on the post title:

- **Old format**: `/news/1234567890abcdef` (Contentful ID)
- **New format**: `/news/your-post-title-here-abc123` (Title-based slug with unique identifier)

The slug generation:
- Converts the post title to lowercase
- Replaces special characters with word equivalents (e.g., `&` â†’ `and`)
- Removes punctuation and special characters
- Replaces spaces with hyphens
- Appends a short unique identifier to prevent conflicts
- Ensures backward compatibility with old ID-based URLs

### Examples
- Title: "New Tournament Rules & Updates!"
